{"text":"How are embeddings stored and retrieved? Embeddings are stored and retrieved using the `add_embeddings`, `upsert_embeddings`, and `update_embeddings` methods. The `add_embeddings` method adds new embeddings to the collection, while the `upsert_embeddings` method updates existing embeddings or adds new ones if they don't already exist. The `update_embeddings` method updates existing embeddings. The embeddings are stored in the `embeddings` attribute of the `EmbeddingStateMachineStates` class. To retrieve embeddings, the `_get` method is used, which sends a POST request to the API endpoint and returns the embeddings, metadatas, and documents associated with the specified collection and query parameters."}
{"text":"Howdoesthetestingwork? The testing in this code involves using the `hypothesis` library to generate test cases for different scenarios. The `test_add` function, for example, uses the `@given` decorator to specify the input data types and generate test cases.

The `test_persist` function tests the persistence of data by creating a collection, adding embeddings, persisting the data, and then retrieving the collection to check if the data is still intact."}
